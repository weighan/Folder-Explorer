# Folder Explorer

Folder explorer was designed to navigate a specific part of my hard drive that had
comics from many artists easily and with minimal hand movement. The controls
allow for my hand to stay on the number pad to navigate the folder and open files.
If a particular artist is disliked, there is an option to delete the file, and
add the artist to a list (text file) for the next application. In this case,
artist names are always in brackets.

Search del file starts searching from the same place as folder explorer and searches
for all artists whose names are on the afforementioned list so they can be deleted.
